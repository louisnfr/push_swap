This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting

#### Points and maximal actions

3 numbers, 3 or less. <br />
5 numbers, 12 or less. <br />

At least **6 points** to pass :
##### With 100 numbers :

5/5 if less than 700 <br />
4/5 if less than 900 <br />
3/5 if less than 1100 <br />
2/5 if less than 1300 <br />
1/5 if less than 1500 <br />

##### With 500 numbers :

5/5 if less than 5500 <br />
4/5 if less than 7000 <br />
3/5 if less than 8500 <br />
2/5 if less than 10000 <br />
1/5 if less than 11500 <br />
