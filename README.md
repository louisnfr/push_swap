This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting

With 3 numbers, we need to sort it with not more than 3 instructions.
With 5 numbers, we need to sort it with not more than 12 instructions.

With 100 numbers :
5/5 if less than 700
4/5 if less than 900
3/5 if less than 1100
2/5 if less than 1300
1/5 if less than 1500

With 500 numbers :
5/5 if less than 5500
4/5 if less than 7000
3/5 if less than 8500
2/5 if less than 10000
1/5 if less than 11500

At least 6 points to pass
